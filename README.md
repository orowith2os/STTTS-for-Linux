# STTTS-for-Linux

Takes some input from a STT program, and converts it to audio via TTS.

To function, these scripts need to have `festival` installed. This is the binary name.
For now, you can pipe a STT program to the `tts.sh` file, and it should work. I'm still looking for some decent STT programs for this.
